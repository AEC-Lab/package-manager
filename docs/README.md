## Overview

<_TODO: insert GIF here_>

Ship is a community-managed central marketplace to discover, install, manage, and deploy software serving the AEC community. The existing market for third-party tools is scattered, difficult to navigate, and suffers from a disconnect between developer and community. Ship seeks to bridge that gap and provide a reliable means to deliver tools directly to their intended audience.

### Who is it for?

Ship is designed for all members of the AEC ecosystem:

- **AEC Community**
  - As an end-user of tools deployed via Ship, you can search, discover, and install plugins and tools available in the marketplace. Monitor a list of your installed applications and check for periodic updates. Get additional information about an application.
- **Developers**
  - Deploy and share your custom application, plugin, and scripts with the AEC community. Provide useful contextual information and examples. Manage user-facing metadata. Integrate directly with your GitHub code.
- **Enterprises** _[future implementation]_
  - Deploy and manage internal tools across your company.

## Roadmap

The initial release focuses on getting core functionality features off the ground, including GitHub integration, download/install, and basic Admin and Developer views. Future features on our list include:

- [ ] **Tool analytics**

  - Provide developers with installation statistics, error logs, and other metrics to help measure success

- [ ] **Troubleshooting forum and developer feedback**

  - Offer a space for community conversation to ask questions, report bugs, provide feedback, post reviews, and rate packages

- [ ] **Create package collections**

  - Define and share a group of packages; highlight interdependent tools; bundle packages needed for your group or organization

- [ ] **Private enterprise management**

  - Deploy internal tools available only to members of your company; manage user access and permissions

- [ ] **Paid applications**
  - Integration with third-party payment systems (e.g. Stripe)
