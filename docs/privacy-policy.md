# Privacy Policy

Ship takes your privacy seriously. To better protect your privacy we provide this privacy policy notice explaining the way your personal information is collected and used.

## Collection of Personal Information

This app tracks basic information about its users. This information includes, but is not limited to, email address, name, packages downloaded, plus profile data passed along if authenticating through a federated identity provider (e.g. Google, GitHub), including but not limited to display name, email address, user name, and profile image. This information is recorded for the following reasons:

- routine administration and maintenance purposes
- improving user experience by persisting package installation status across multiple devices (e.g. letting a user know if a package update is available)
- determining administrative privileges for package authors
- tracking download and usage statistics to help developers measure package performance
- identifying user membership or access to private packages or collections

## Package Content and Links to Third Party Websites

By the nature of this app, third-party developers are able to list software packages for users to download. As part of the download/install process, the developer is able to specify a series of operations that will run on your local file system in order to install or uninstall the package and its contents, including, but not limited to, copying files from one directory to another, deleting files or directories, and running executables (e.g. `.bat`, `.exe`, etc.).

While we strive to monitor packages for authenticity and reputation, we are not responsible for any information collected by the installed contents from packages. We do not offer any guarantee or protection that installed contents are free of malicious code.

Developers may include links to websites in package detail descriptions and elsewhere across the app. We are not responsible for the privacy policies on these websites. You should be aware that the privacy policies of these websites may differ from our own.

## Security

The security of your personal information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

## Changes To This Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy is effective as of February 16, 2021 and will remain in effect except with respect to any changes in its provisions in the future, which will be in effect immediately after being posted on this page.

We reserve the right to update or change our Privacy Policy at any time and you should check this Privacy Policy periodically. If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you either through the email address you have provided us, or by placing a prominent notice on our app.
