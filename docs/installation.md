# Installation

Download and run the `package-manager-setup.exe` file from the latest GitHub release [here](https://github.com/voyansi/package-manager/releases)

Package Manager is currently available for Windows 10 and later.

### Updates

The app will automatically check for and install any updates each time you open it. No need to download anything else to stay up to date.

### Sign-up + Sign-in

Use one of the available third-party providers (Google, GitHub) to sign in, or register with an email and password. When signing up with an email and password, you will be required to verify your email with a link sent to your account.

If you need to access private packages managed by your organization, be sure to sign in with the enterprise email or Google account for that organization.

If you are a developer looking to deploy or manage your packages, you must be signed in via GitHub with the account that has the "owner" role on whichever organization the source repositories belong to.
